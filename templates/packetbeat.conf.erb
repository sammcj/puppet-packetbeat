### Packetbeat Agent configuration file.
###
### Packetbeat is a protocol monitoring service that
### works by sniffing the network traffic between your application
### components. It dumps the results into Elasticsearch.

### Go to http://packetbeat.com/getstarted for more details.

[elasticsearch]
# Set the host and port where to find Elasticsearch.
host  = "<%= @host %>"
port  = <%= @port %>
index = "packetbeat"

[interfaces]
# Select on which network interfaces to sniff. You can use the "any"
# keyword to sniff on all connected interfaces.
device = "<%= @interfaces %>"

[agent]
# The name of the agent as it will show up in the web interface. If not
# defined, we will just use the hostname.
#
name= "<%= @agentname %>"

[runoptions]
# The Packetbeat agent can drop privileges after creating the sniffing
# socket. Root access is required for opening the socket but everything
# else requires no privileges. Therefore, it is strongly recommended
# to have the Agent switch users after the initialization phase.
# The following two settings set the User Id and the Group Id under
# which the Agent will run.
# Warning: Because on Linux Setuid doesn't change the uid of all threads,
# the Go garbage collector will continue to run as root.
# Note: Process monitoring only works when running as root.
uid=<%= @uid %>
gid=<%= @gid %>

#[logging]
## These are debug helpers to control the verbosity of logging.
